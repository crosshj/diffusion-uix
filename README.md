this is an attempt to hack features onto Automatic's UI.
in part, this means creating a new client, see example https://crosshj.com/diffusion-uix/

### wish list
- proper multi-tenancy
- more control over UI (TODO: expand on this idea as time allows)

### resources
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
