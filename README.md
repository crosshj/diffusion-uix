# diffusion-uix
 
this is an attempt to hack features onto Automatic's UI.   
in part, this means creating a new client, see example https://crosshj.com/diffusion-uix/

### wish list
- proper multi-tenancy
	- each user has their own results and settings
	- some users have a simplified view of features
	- some users have advanced control & visibility
- more control over UI (TODO: expand on this idea as time allows)
	- add features from civitai remotely
	- recover from automatic111's failure state

### resources
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
